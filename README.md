# modusponens-prototype
A prototype implementation of NeColus with the modus ponens rule.

**NOTE**: Currently NeColus is implemented; the modus ponens rule is to be
added.

**TODO**: The bounds in the cabal file might be too tight (automatically
generated by `cabal init`). Relax them as much as possible.
